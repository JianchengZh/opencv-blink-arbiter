# opencv-blink-arbiter
**Goal:** Detecting specific type of human face motions using camera on a mobile device

**Requirements:** 

Create a mobile application, that counts, how many times the human was blinking during the specified amount of time (could be hardcoded or specified in settings). The application, when it is started, opens camera and performs motion count. When motion is detected, the information about it is displayed for 1 sec (like “blink detected”) on top of camera screen. Once time is out, then the result screen is showed to user, where the last one could read the information about his “blinking activity” and press the button to start motion detection again.

**Motion Type:** Eye blinking

**Platform:** Android

**Preferred tool:** OpenCV
